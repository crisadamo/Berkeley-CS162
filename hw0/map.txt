Use objdump with the -D flag on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the output of
running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment/section is each defined in?

_main recur两个函数定义在.text中；
foo: .rss段中，不分配内存，初始化为0
stuff: .data段中，进行初始化。
char*指针变量和i分配在函数栈上。
heap内存分配在对应的堆内存上。

Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for (look up their names on the
Internet if you don’t know).
.text  代码段
.data  全局数据，或者静态数据，需要进行初始化
.rss   全局数据，或者静态数据，未初始化，不分配内存。


What direction is the stack growing in?
栈地址从高到底。


Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous? (e.g. is there any extra space between their
addresses?)

两个heap不连续
